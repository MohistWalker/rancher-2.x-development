# Developing for Rancher 2.x

I want to use the open source kubernetes cluster management tool [Rancher 2.x](https://rancher.com) in my company and love the idea that we can contribute to the development of it. Unfortunately currently there is not much documentation for developers who like to contribute to this great project, fix bugs, create enhancements.

This is a try to collect information about how to develop for Rancher 2.x. I'd like to invite you all to contribute to the documentation for developers.
